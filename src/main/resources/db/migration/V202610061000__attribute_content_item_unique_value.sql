-- Store each plaintext attribute value once per definition. Concurrent first writes, and turning a definition's
-- encryption off, could store a value twice, and every later write of it then failed. Fold existing duplicates, then
-- let a unique constraint keep it that way.
--
-- json_digest is the SHA-256 of the value's jsonb text, as the lookup by value computes it: key order and spacing
-- normalize away, a number's written precision does not, so 1.0 and 1.00 are two values. It is NULL for an encrypted
-- row, whose json is a placeholder shared by every value, so encrypted rows stay one per object, outside the rule.
--
-- A digest because a btree entry cannot hold a value over ~2.7 kB; SHA-256 because jsonb_hash_extended gives [{},{}]
-- and [[],[]] one hash and md5() fails on a FIPS-mode server. convert_to() is not immutable, so the text reaches
-- sha256() through decode(..., 'escape'), each backslash doubled because that format reads it as an escape. Adding the
-- stored column rewrites the table.

-- Duplicates are matched on the text the digest is taken from: jsonb equality would fold 1.0 and 1.00 together.
