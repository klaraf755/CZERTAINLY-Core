/**
 * One CBOM's contribution to one cryptographic asset: the payload that CBOM reported, the evidence of where it was
 * seen, and how often.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code originalCryptoProperties} is retained per source rather than merged away. That retention is what makes the
 * asset-level merge reversible and an alias repair exact: undoing either re-derives everything from the payloads that
 * are still here, with nothing to reconstruct.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code occurrenceCount} counts what was seen, including occurrences the evidence cap dropped, so the gap against the
 * retained {@code evidence} array is the visible record that capping happened.
