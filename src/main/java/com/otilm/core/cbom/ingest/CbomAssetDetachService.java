/**
 * Withdraws one CBOM's contribution to the cryptographic asset inventory, and settles what that withdrawal leaves
 * behind.
 *
 * <p>
 * The orchestrator half of a bean pair, like {@link CbomAssetIngestService}: it owns the transaction boundaries and
 * composes the writers, and writes nothing itself.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>The orphan rule.</b> An asset whose last source is withdrawn is deleted, unless an alias is <em>pointed at</em> it
 * -- that is, its key is some alias's canonical key -- in which case the row is kept with {@code source_count} at zero
 * and its payload cleared. The inventory is meant to say what the documents currently say, and a row nothing sources
 * any more says nothing; but an alias is an operator's decision about which assets are the same asset,
 * {@code crypto_asset_alias} cascades from the canonical row, and a sweep no operator asked for must not discard that
 * decision silently. The absorbed side carries no such risk -- the alias table has no foreign key on
 * {@code absorbed_key}, and an absorbed row that no longer exists is its normal state -- so an orphan named only there
 * is collected like any other.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>A kept orphan is a row state nothing produced before this class.</b> {@code source_count = 0} with no payload is
 * listed, paginated and counted by the cryptographic asset API exactly like a sourced asset, because no read path has a
 * {@code source_count > 0} predicate. That is deliberate for now -- the row is kept precisely so an operator can still
 * see and unmerge the decision that holds it, and hiding it would make the alias unreachable through the API that
 * created it -- but it does mean the inventory's totals count assets no document currently mentions. Recorded as open
 * work on core#2073.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Why a batch may be abandoned, and what survives it.</b> Every batch takes
 * {@link CbomAssetIngestService#assetSyncLockKey(UUID) the withdrawn CBOM's asset-sync lock} and gives up when another
 * node holds it, exactly as ingest does -- the two paths write the same rows, and the lock is what keeps one node at a
 * time on them. The key is the document's, not the operation's, so a withdrawal and an unrelated document's ingest do
 * not contend; the pair that must exclude each other is this withdrawal and an ingest of the same CBOM, which share the
 * key.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each batch commits in its own transaction, so giving up is <b>not</b> all-or-nothing: the batches that already
 * committed stay committed, their orphans included, and deleting an orphan is not reversible. What the caller is
 * promised is only that no more than its own unit of work is lost -- {@link Withdrawal#complete()} says whether the
 * rest was reached, and the counts describe what really happened either way. That is safe because the caller leaves the
 * CBOM owing the work and the next run redoes the whole withdrawal idempotently; it is not safe to ignore, because a
 * revision left half-withdrawn still sources part of an inventory another revision now speaks for.
