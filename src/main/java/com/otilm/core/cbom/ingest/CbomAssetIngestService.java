/**
 * Ingests one CBOM's cryptographic assets as a single unit of work.
 *
 * <p>
 * The orchestrator half of the bean pair: it owns the transaction boundaries and composes the writers, and writes
 * nothing itself. {@code NOT_SUPPORTED} because a caller may hand it a document it has just fetched while its own
 * transaction is open, and because the state writes have to commit independently of the asset writes -- see below.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>The document is a parameter, never a fetch.</b> Every caller has the document already, and taking it as an
 * argument is what keeps the HTTP read outside the transaction that holds the cluster lock.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Three boundaries, and why each is its own transaction.</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code markInProgress} / {@code markSynced} / {@code markFailed} run in their own transactions, because
 * {@link CbomAssetSyncStateWriter} is {@code REQUIRED} and would otherwise enrol the state in the very transaction that
 * is failing -- the failure would then roll back the record of itself, and the operator would see a CBOM that looks
 * untouched.</li>
 * <li>Each batch of asset writes runs in its own transaction and takes {@link #assetSyncLockKey(UUID) this CBOM's
 * asset-sync lock} inside it. That lock is transaction-scoped, so it is released at every batch commit rather than held
 * across the document: a second node can take it in the gap, and the first node then abandons the rest of the document
 * at its next batch. Safe, because every write is an idempotent upsert and the CBOM goes on owing an ingest -- but it
 * is why a batch is bounded by {@code cbom.sync.asset-batch-size} rather than by the document.</li>
 * <li>Inside a batch, {@link CryptoAssetAliasWriter#ALIAS_DECISION_LOCK} is taken <b>before the first asset row
 * lock</b>. That lock outranks every {@code crypto_asset} row lock, so a transaction that upserts a source first and
 * stamps a guard second would deadlock against one doing the reverse.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Lock ranking, third rank included.</b> The asset-sync lock is taken above {@code ALIAS_DECISION_LOCK}, which is
 * above every {@code crypto_asset} row lock. The asset-sync lock is only ever acquired with a non-blocking
 * {@code tryLock}, so a node that cannot get it abandons the batch rather than joining a wait chain; acquiring it with
 * a blocking call would close a cycle against any path that takes the two in the other order.
