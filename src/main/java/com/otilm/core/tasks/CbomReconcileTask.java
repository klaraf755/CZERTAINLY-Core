/**
 * The weekly pass: the repository's whole listing, not the window since the last hourly run.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>What the hourly pass cannot recover.</b> {@code cbomSyncOverlapSeconds} and the {@code cbom_sync_skip} retry
 * budget together cover an entry the feed <em>offered</em> and Core then failed on -- clock skew against the object
 * store, an in-flight upload, a document that could not be read for a moment. Neither covers an entry the feed never
 * offered inside any window Core asked for: a run that recorded SUCCESS after the listing had already moved past an
 * entry, a repository that back-dated one, an entry written off as permanently skipped while its listing window closed
 * behind it. Those are invisible to a pass that only ever looks forward from a watermark, and this is the pass that
 * sees them.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>It cannot resurrect what an operator deleted.</b> Deletion in Core is not deletion in the repository, so the whole
 * listing still offers every deleted document; the feed pass tests {@code cbom_tombstone} before storing an entry,
 * which is what makes a full re-list safe to run at all.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Sunday 02:30.</b> A full listing over a large estate is the longest CBOM job a deployment runs, and the scheduler
 * listener is concurrent ({@code messaging.concurrency.scheduler}), so it does not hold the jobs behind it -- which is
 * also why a reconcile and an hourly sync can be in flight at once, and why every rule the two share has to hold under
 * that. The hour is chosen to miss the hourly sync (:00) and the PQC sweep (:30 hourly is the same minute, but this
 * fires on one day of the week and the sweep's work is bounded by its batch budget).
